                    During my academic journey. I had the privilege of delving deep
                    into the worlds of cyber security and software development.
                    My dedication to continue learning led me to enhancing my skills
                    in both worlds - my personal favourites are cyber forensics and
                    coding.

                    Outside the realm of cybersecurity, you'll find me developing
                    projects that make tasks convenient, or adding features for
                    video games. I like a well-balanced life so I also love 
                    spending my time running, hiking, camping and generally
                    being outside in nature.
